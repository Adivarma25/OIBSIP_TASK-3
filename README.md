# Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict car prices. Below are the steps followed in building the ML model:

## Steps to Build the ML Model

1. *Import Dataset*: Import the dataset containing car information.

2. *Visualize the Dataset*: Visualize the dataset to gain insights into the data.

3. *Split Data*: Split the data into training and testing sets.

4. *Rescale Features*: Use MinMaxScaler to rescale the features.

5. *Build Model*: Build a linear regression model for price prediction.

6. *Residual Analysis*: Analyze the residuals of the training data to check for model assumptions.

7. *Make Predictions*: Use the trained model to make price predictions.

8. *Model Evaluation*: Evaluate the model's performance, including calculating R-squared.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas for data manipulation.
- Numpy for numerical operations.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Scikit-Learn for machine learning tools.
- Statsmodels for detailed statistics.

## Usage

You can follow the steps mentioned above to build and evaluate the car price prediction model.

## Results

The R-squared value on the test set provides an indication of the model's predictive performance.
